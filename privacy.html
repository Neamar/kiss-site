				<h2>KISS Privacy policy</h2>
				<p><strong>KISS does not, and will never, have access to Internet. Your data is <em>your</em> data.</strong></p>
					<ul class="privacy">
					<li>KISS requires the Contact permission to let you search through your contacts. Nothing is stored, and nothing is sent on Internet&mdash;KISS can't communicate with Internet.</li>
					<li>KISS requires the Camera permission to enable and disable the flashlight. Actual camera data is never accessed, read or stored in any way.</li>
					<li>KISS requires Network permission to enable and disable wifi and mobile connectivity on the device. This does not mean that KISS can access internet, it can just change your device connectivity settings. KISS will never do so unless you explicitly ask it to.</li>
					<li>KISS has access to incoming text messages to automatically populate contact history. This is optional. Actual message content is never accessed, and never stored.</li>
					<li>KISS requires the Call permission to let you call your contacts. KISS will never do so unless you explicitly ask it to.</li>
				</ul>
